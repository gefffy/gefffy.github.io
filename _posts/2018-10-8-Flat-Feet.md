Flat Feet or Pes Planus is defined as a deformity of the arches in which arch of the foot collapses towards the ground

### I've "suffered" from flat feet for as long as I can remember
The literature over the past years has begun to change and take a different stance. Flat used used to be called a "deformity" or
a "problem". It was something that needed to be fixed. Now many podiatrists, physical therapists, and docotrs are begining to realize
that flat feet may actually be a hereditary trait.

Over the past few years, I thought that my flat feet were a "problem" and I needed to fix it. I began doing calf raises, foot exercises,
foot stretches, just about anything to try and lift my arch. But, I never seemed to get anywhere.

More recently, I've began looking into research articles that actually analyze and compare arches and feet between different
populations. For instance [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3585310/) study here looks at the differences in
pressure distribution between Dutch and Malawian adults. What they found is that Malawians had an overall lower arch, but had a
much better even distribution of pressure over the entire foot. I recommend you read the whole article, summarizing it isn't a good idea.
