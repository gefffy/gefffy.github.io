I recently read this great [article](http://www.ameliabooneracing.com/blog/rehab/the-injury-commandments/) by Amelia Boone and it has been my bible.
This has been a shit year for exercising, stress fracture followed by plantar fascitis followed by a strained knee ligament all on top of consistent sciatica.
I'm here to document what works, what doesn't, and my hopeful recovery
