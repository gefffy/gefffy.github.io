title: I'm either terrible at exercising or extrmely fragile - Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) Strains

MCL strains are graded from 1-3: 1 is a strain, 2 is a partial tear, 3 is a complete tear

### I'm fairly sure I gave myself a grade 1 MCL strain by riding a stationary bike while on a vacation to Japan.

It is the most stupid and aggravating injury. I was on a cruise and there were nice spin bikes in the cardio room, but
you're not allowed to use them unless an instructor is present. I tried to use them and got kicked off... So the alternative
is this great plastic stationary bike that has no seat adjustments other than height. I should have realized that it was a bad idea
when the exercise program is some sort of cycling game where you literally steer the handlebars to race AI. 

(Quick sidenote, I am not a beginner cyclist, I've been riding for 10+ years) 

Anyways, I rode that bad boy doing sprint intervals of 30 seconds on and 1 minute off for 12 sets with 5 minute warmup and 10 minute cooldown. 
I noticed while I was riding that the seat was tilted forward and I had to sort of balance myself to keep my butt from sliding off
the saddle. Once I got off, I felt a pain on the medial side of my right knee and the damage was done. Fast forward 2 weeks, I'm riding
a real spin bike doing the same workout and when I get off I definitely felt some pain in my knee.

This brings me to now, I'm pissed. I can't swim now which was my main method of exercising. I'm sort of just floundering around
waiting for something to heal up so I can start exercising again. It definitely feels like I got hit with a injury combo and it is
way too easy to point fingers and blame the cruise or something, but I caused it. I'm sticking to the [10 injury commandments](https://gefffy.github.io/Healing/)
and I am now taking 2 weeks off from any lower body exercise. This means I'm only doing some light upperbody lifting, core, 
and stretching things that don't aggravate the knee.

### As far as fixing it, I think rest and ice is going to be the best solution.
