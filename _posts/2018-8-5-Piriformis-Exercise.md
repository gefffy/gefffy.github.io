title: Piriformis Problems

Here's a great YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lli_rI4Dj0Y) for working on the piriformis.

I'm a big believer in strengthening muscles rather than only stretching them. This exercise really
targets the piriformis, or at least I think its my piriformis, better than clamshells or lateral leg raises.
With those, I tend to get more glute activation rather than some isolated piriformis action.
